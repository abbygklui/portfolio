    <h2>About this Project</h2>
    <br>
    <p>PrepU is a web app that satisfies the market for an accessible and effective job interview preparation program to 
      help develop compelling communication skills and advance career goals. 
      This project was made possible with the help of the ADA Mentorship program, ran with Women in Tech Society (WITS), 
      which helps students develop a technical project with the help of professional developers.</p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <h1 class="bottomsmallestspace">
      There is a lack of online interview preparation products available for students​.
    </h1>
    <p>Online interviews are becoming increasingly prevalent. This growth has been accelerated by COVID 19. 
      It has been difficult for university students to obtain feedback from pre-recorded online interviews​ or to recieve professional 
      advice through mock interviews on digital platforms. </p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <br>
    <p>In order to best succeed in this goal, we decided to direct our project in the direction of a common way to prepare for interviews - mock interviews. </p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-4 m-auto">
        <h3>Flexible</h3>
        <p>Personalized and customizable features to can be set prior to the mock interview<p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-4 m-auto">
        <h3>Convenient</h3>
        <p>Users can quickly practice for their interview anytime, anywhere<p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-4 m-auto">
        <h3>Practical</h3>
        <p>The application provides all forms of feedback - from punctuation to stylistic errors<p>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container space">
  <div class="space" style="text-align: left;">
    <h2>The Vision</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Our vision was to create a interview prep service that users will be comfortable repeatedly using, with the benefits of privacy and no-judgement. 
      A key priority was to focus on usability and features that would allow flexability for different types of interviews.  </p>
  </div>
</div>


  <div class="container space">
    <div class="space" style="text-align: left;">
      <h1 class="smallspace">How We Got There</h1>
      <h2 >Discoveries/Observations</h2>
      <div class="smallspace">
        <p style="color: #999999;">1. Competative Analysis</p>
        <p>We wanted insight on key features that are analyzed during interviews and what mistakes are commonly made. 
          We also wanted to know exactly where our project would place in the market. 
          I dove into platforms that were related to our project, including softwares used for employers to analyze interviews. I pointed out key features, interesting facts, targets, and visuals of different 
          platforms, including Hirevue, Phonic, IMotion, and Interview.AI. 
          We also looked at features that would affect the chance of being hired outside the use of software.   </p>
      </div>
      <p style="color: #999999;">Key Takeaways</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
          <li>There is no accessible mock interview practice program that analyzes voice and image for students</li>
          <li>Platforms that use machine learning to analyze voice and image during interviews are directed for employers</li>
          <li>Common features that affect hiring include grammer, behaviour (particularly confidence), and responses</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
      </div>

  <div class="container space">
    <p style="color: #999999;">Target Audience</p>
    <p>Undergraduates or recent grads of any gender or age who come out of highschool/university/college with limited experience with job interviews. 
      They have a busy schedule and want a flexible training program to further develop their communications skills. It is important for kick-starting their career and starting off strong.   </p>

    </div>
  
  <div class="container space">
    <p>Before moving forward, we had to determine every aspect, particularly the pain points of the user. 
      As students, we recognized many obstacles our user may face. 
      We conducted a user journey map to determine opportunities at each stage. </p>

    <div class="container space">
      <div class="space" style="text-align: left;">
        <p style="color: #999999;">2. User Survey</p>
        <br>
        <p>We then conducted a survey with a focus group of university students for feedback on current prioritized features and concepts they would find useful when practicing for an interview. Through both research and survey analysis, we could find what would be benefitial from all perspectives that may affect an interview.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p style="color: #999999;">Key Takeaways</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
          <li>Students want to have feedback given to the user along the way, then in-depth feedback after finishing the interview, so that they will know what mistakes they are making while presenting</li>
          <li>Students want to have feedback on body language for better self expression</li>
          <li>Students would prefer to have basic + premium subscription offerings over advert-based. 
            Students believed that advertisments would be overwelming and take away from the interview experience.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>



<div class="container space">
  <div class="space" style="text-align: left;">
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The main challenge our team was facing was the feasibility of developing different features by the deadline of our project. 
      This became an important consideration when we were designing the platform. We often reflected on what we were creating to determine if our ideas would be practical for development. 
<br>
<br>
      Using Miro, we worked with the developers to determine the key factors we would include.  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="smallspace">
    <img src="Images/ada clusters.png" alt="Clusters" style="max-width: 100%;border-radius: 2%;">
    </div>
</div>


<div class="container space">
  <div class="space" style="text-align: left;">
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <br>
    <p>We then mapped out the flow of the application before we started to wireframe our design. 
      This helped us understand the state of the user and patterns they may take when using the product. 
      We then asked for feedback from the team and mentors then tweaked our process to match their suggestions.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="smallspace">
    <img src="Images/ada flow.png" alt="Flow" style="max-width: 100%;border-radius: 2%;">
    </div>
</div>

<div class="container space">
  <p>From here, we mapped out lo-fidelity mock-ups of each page of our application, 
    focusing on general features of our product based on our finalized research. When working on the design, 
    I often asked myself, “does the user need this?” to focus on the experience rather then unneccessary elements. 
  </p>
  <div class="smallspace">
  <img src="Images/ADA Wireframe.png" alt="Wireframes" style="max-width: 100%;border-radius: 2%;">
</div>
</div>


<div class="container space">
  <p>The elements should also allow flexibility to keep the user comfortable, instead of overwelming them. 
    The live feedback on the right became a sidebar, so that users could choose if they would want to read their feedback during the interview or choose to keep the feedback hidden. 
    In further iterations, I added more features to help keep the user comfortable and less distracted throughout the interview. 
    They could choose to change any settings, such as quickly turning their camera off and expanding the video to fit their screen.

<div class="container space">
  <div class="space" style="text-align: left;">
    <h2>Branding</h2>
    <br>
    <p>At this stage, we finalized how we wanted our design to look like. 
      We wanted the layout to be professional, clean, and invisible. 
      We kept our style guide limited to what was essential to the user. </p>

    <h2>My Reflection</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Through this project, I learned the <b>importance of considering feasability and technical constraints</b> that would occur at the later stages of the project. 
      From the start of the project, if we had asked ourselves questions such as 
      “Are we going to be able to code certain features such as body language,” just as much as we had analyzed each aspect that would improve usability, 
      we would have a better focus on critical features that would be developed. 
      <br>
      <br>

      Overall, this was a fun project to work on and it felt good to see what we had accomplished together in the past few months. 
      In March 2021, our project was announced as the winner of this year's ADA Mentorship program, with the best overall technical implementation and user interface design.
