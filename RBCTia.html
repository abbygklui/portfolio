    <h2>About this Project</h2>
    <br>
    <p> As a designer for RBC's Tia, a guided Al-based tech-support tool that can help employees resolve common technical issues, one of the projects I led this term was the redesign of Tia's webpage. Through user testing sessions, I validated that the website lacked engaging and informative content for users. In turn, many users had difficulty understanding how to use Tia and learning about Tia's features. By analyzing the product using design thinking and stages of user testing, I redesigned the website as a home for users to interact with Tia while understanding and adopting Tia's capabilities.

    <h2>What is Tia?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Tia (they/them) is a guided AI-based tech support tool that helps all RBC employees resolve common technology issues. Tia brings a better end-user experience with lower operational costs for the employee and customer-facing contact centers. They resolve common tech issues before the users reach the help desk, encourage self-service solutions, automate tasks, eliminate frustration and simplify the steps to arrive at the solution.

      The current landing page is unengaging and difficult to understand, impacting how users experience Tia.

    <h2>My Vision</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      My vision for the new landing page is to help employees learn how to use Tia and adopt the features offered. In turn, this would drive more engagement and improve the user experience, to enable employees to self-serve and automate their technology issues. Currently, 20 000 employees have access to Tia through the webpage. However, Tia is on track to be launched to all RBC employees by the end of the fall and will be added to major internal employees' applications by September 2022. This webpage will act as a bridge for employees to adopt and learn more about how to use Tia and what they can help with.

        <!-- <p style="color: #999999;">1. Competitive Analysis</p> -->
        <p>
          To continue analyzing the problem and determine all considerations, I decided to conduct 7 user testing sessions with both new and pilot employees based on the current website design. Through these sessions, I hoped to gain key information about what employees in different sectors need and feel when interacting with the page and chatbot. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I started off by leading a user testing exercise with my team to understand the objective, target users, questions, and task overviews.

      <p style="color: #999999;">Top 3 Questions</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Did users find an answer to their questions when visiting the webpage?</li>
        <li>How can we drive value to our key users to use Tia rather than contact the help desk?</li>
        <li>How can we drive engagement, awareness, and expectations to help users understand Tia’s features?</li>

      The key venture for this stage was learning about RBC’s internal strategy and branding, and how to execute this experience together with Tia’s values and personality. At this stage, I analyzed RBC’s brand space guidelines and spoke with enterprise designers. I created a mood board to form a new brand strategy for Tia.

        During the testing sessions, I often noted that <b>employees don’t have the time</b> to read detailed content. Users didn’t have time to read updated emails or articles about Tia. Many never read through the landing page. On top of that, <b>users that are using Tia are frustrated.</b> They have been going through a technology issue and coming to Tia in hopes of solving it. Something that is complex and time-consuming would just add to their frustration.

    <p>
      The old landing page generated very few responses for the feedback form, although the button that leads to the form is at the top of the page. This was because the Jira form was very text heavy and required unnecessary navigation to find the correct form to fill out.

        <p>My initial idea was to have the form directly on Tia. Since Tia already has access to the employee’s personal information, I thought that having a place to input text and an email imput for confirmation would be enough since we should already know about the user.</p>

      As I wanted employees to focus on using Tia when visiting the page, I avoided adding links and buttons near the top. Instead, the top section gives a brief introduction to Tia and the main features. The bottom of the page consists of all the links, with the footer leading to resources and a small section with a call to action to visit the Connect site (Connect is RBC’s internal version of “Facebook”.)

      One important thing to consider is how well my design supports social inclusion for people of different disabilities and ages. Using Able, a Figma Plugin to simulate colour contrast and colour blindness, I checked if the text, images, and components passed the guidelines. I then spoke with the developer to see if there were any gaps in my design that might affect the accessibility when using a screen reader.

  <h2 >Uncovering Additional User Insights</h2>
  <div class="smallspace">
    <!-- <p style="color: #999999;">1. Competitive Analysis</p> -->
    <p>
      Before moving on to implementation, I wanted to run a set of individual user testing to receive feedback on the current design from a mix of employees. I conducted 12 sessions and documented the key findings on Mural. (Special thanks to Valeria Gongaza for helping me take notes during the sessions.)
    </p>

  
  <p style="color: #999999;">Key Takeaways</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Users wanted something that made it easier for them to get to each section    </li>
    <li>New employees and interns were confused about some of the content because they were not familiar with the wording</li>
  </ul>  

  <p>Overall, employees found the landing page easy to navigate and understand.  </p>



  <div class="row smallspace">
    <img src="Images/RBCTia_UserTestingNotes2.png" alt="User Testing Notes" style="max-width: 100%;border-radius: 2%;">
    </div>

    <p>
      To solve the first takeaway, I added a menu navigation at the top of the page. This will help users find what they are looking for effectively and call more attention to the feedback section of the page.
      <br>
      <br>
      The second takeaway focused on the content and wording. With my team, I simplified the test to make it more understandable for users that had just onboarded into RBC.
      <br>
      <br>
      After implementing these design changes, I spoke with a member of the brand identity team for approval. I then worked with the team for the page to go into development.

    <h2>My Reflection</h2>
    <br>
    <p> 

      What I learned

      

      The imporance of being on the same Page - not everyone is a designer / understands design

      Asking why



      At the start of the project, I found that there were little things 
      
      The team was used to fast rollouts for design - the old designer never used research - this affected deadlines, and as it is a redesign, \
      
      
      Through this project, I learned the <b>importance of considering feasability and technical constraints</b> that would occur at the later stages of the project. 
      From the start of the project, if we had asked ourselves questions such as 
      “Are we going to be able to code certain features such as body language,” just as much as we had analyzed each aspect that would improve usability, 
      we would have a better focus on critical features that would be developed. 
      <br>
      <br>

      Overall, this was a fun project to work on and it felt good to see what we had accomplished together in the past few months. 
      In March 2021, our project was announced as the winner of this year's ADA Mentorship program, with the best overall technical implementation and user interface design.
      <br>

      Thank you for reading!</p>



      The month following the launch of the free consultation page became the most successful one yet - with a surge in sales and an improvement in customer ratings. 
      This project helped me learn a lot about how to determine features that would be valuable to the user prior to completing a digital consultation. 
      I found myself constantly thinking about content and placement that would effectively communicate Jack Health’s values and products. 
      It was extremely interesting to focus on the importance of design in business.

    <h2>My Reflection</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      This was the first time I had ever led a project that would be launched to such a large range of employees. This was also the first time I had ever worked at a corporate company. At the start, I started having feelings of self-doubt that I was the right person to lead the project. I felt slightly intimidated to be working at a financial institution and wasn’t sure if I would know how RBC’s employees operate well enough.

After receiving advice from internal designers and meeting different employees across the bank when conducting the first stage of user testing, I started to gain more confidence in myself. Instead of comparing how capable I was, I found that any conversation I had became an opportunity for me to listen and learn more. Every employee gave me great insight into both RBC’s culture and their way of thinking. It is normal not to know everything, and I would continue to find out more as I progressed.

      <br>
